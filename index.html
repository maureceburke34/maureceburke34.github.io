        <p> Hello my name is Maurece Burke. Right now I go to Thomas A Edison highschool.<br>
            In Edison I take a web design program where I have used good material like popcode, python and photoshop to gain more knowledge in coding.<br>
            I have created a portfolio to show my progress and activity I have done.<br>
